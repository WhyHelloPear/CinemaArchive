# Cinema Archive

Blah blah, description of project and general intentions of what I'd like to do

----------




###Database
The 'DataAccess' project within the Infrastructure layer uses a code first approach to define the schema of the 'CinemaArchive' db. The entity models defined within the project dictate how the tables are ultimately structured and the creation/updating of said schema are controlled with migration scripts generated by EF Core. 

#####Create Migration to Alter Database Schema
>
```
dotnet ef migrations add [MIGRATION_NAME] --project DataAccess
```

#####Update Database From Migration
```
dotnet ef database update
```

or if you would only like to run a single migration script, use the following command

```
dotnet ef database update [MIGRATION_NAME] --project DataAccess
```
